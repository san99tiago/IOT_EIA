# WEB_IOT_EIA :satellite:

This repository includes a series of projects related to simple IOT applications.

## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
There are multiple Platforms and Softwares in order to create this project.
The best way to understand the way they work is from looking at the purpose of each file and its usage.

### Hardware dependencies
* PIC18F2550 MICROCONTROLLER. <br />
This is the main mricrocontroller that we will use for programming all the low-level processing and features of the IOT apps.

* ESP8266-01 <br />
This awesome OpenSource module is the one that we use for connecting the Microcontrollers and achieve the correct Requests and Responses to the servers.

* OTHER ELECTRONIC BASIC COMPONENTS <br />
For testing the real IOT applications with the actual devices, it's important to understand properly the Datasheets and requirements that the electronic devices need.
In this case, I won't give you all details, because they are based on your needs and experience.


### Software dependencies
* MPLAB X IDE <br />
This is the default development environment (from Microchip Community). Is the one that we use for programming and debugging all the PIC Microcontrollers.

* 

### Libraries and Package dependencies


## Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose.

It is also important to understand that the IOT applications involve a series of simple steps and you must start from the simple, 
and try to develop more complex apps from good basic pilars.

I will be updloading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to my professor and friend: Alejo Puerta.
* Thank to all contributors for the great OpenSource projects that I am using.
